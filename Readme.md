This is the GUI that displays the voltage of each cell in the pack. In addition it displays 15 temperatures throughout each subpack and 3 slave board temperatures per subpack.

The purpose of this GUI is to demonstrate to the judges that our BMS correctly balances cells and charges correctly during A-Tech at the Formula SAE Competition. In addition, it's a useful internal tool to troubleshoot our BMS.
